## <a name="williamson-2008"></a> Sprawl, Spatial Location, and Politics: How Ideological Identification Tracks the Built Environment
Thad Williamson | 2008

* The goal of this paper is to understand how spatial context influences partisan vote composition.
* Data: US Census 2000 data and 2000 Social Capital Community Benchmark Survey.
* Does higher levels of sprawl (suburbanization) lead to greater conservatism among people living in those regions? 
* Bickford (2000) argues that suburbia is great for fostering conservative ideologies because there is so much space and little room for interaction. Also, these communities are predominately white so there are limits in terms of diversity.
* The patterns in the US are also seen in Canada.
* In this study, the researchers did consider many other variables including gender, education, self selection of place of residence and other factors but find that they are not adequate in explaining the differences between voting habits
* In places where people are less dependent on cars to travel, they are more likely to engage with others and vote more liberally

## <a name="benton-2007"></a> The Rural-Urban Division in UK Politics
Ted Benton | 2007

* The British have a culture of valuing rural life as an alternative to the crowdedness of the urban centers and aim to bridge the differences in the rural/urban divide.
* After WWI, the UK government spend a lot of energy and resources towards the development of the countryside.
* Farming subsidies led to the successful industrialization of agriculture
* However, with the election of a new labor party in 1997, farmers found themselves in a position of declining economic and social influence. They unionize and form the Countryside Alliance with a goal of taking back their previous, well-respected status.
* There is not necessarily a rural-urban divide in political values, but on issues. Rural residents prefer there to be more energy towards sustainable food development and the protection of wildlife, but the urban dwellers have other interests.
* Rural residents also favor more rural housing, something that the government is trying to develop in order to combat homelessness.
* The protection of rural villages are crucial, not just for the environment, but also for the leisure and travel needs of the urban dwellers. As such, the urbanites also favor rural protection, just not in the way the rural folks see it.

## <a name="walks2005"></a> The City-Suburban Cleavage in Canadian Federal Politics
R. Allen Wlaks | January 2005

* In the most recent Canadian Elections, residents of the suburbs are more likely to be fiscally conservative and are more likely to vote for right-wing politicians.
* This study aims to address the differences between urban and suburban residents in terms of their voting behavior.
* From research done in the 1960s, scholars agree that a new social and political environment emerged in the suburbs which can be due to segregation (in the case of the United States)
* The data for this study uses a time series of Canadian election results from the 1940s to 1997. 
* The results suggest that there is a disparity between inner city and suburban voting patterns.
* The differences in rural-urban voting happened in the 1970s.
* Therefore, there are differences between urban and rural residents in their voting patterns, and these differences have increasingly diverged when suburban residents increasingly vote for right winged parties and urban residents vote for the left winged parties.

## <a name="barkan2006"></a> Space Matters: Designing Better Electoral Systems for Emerging Democracies
Joel D. Barkan, Paul J. Densham, and Gerard Rushton | October 2006

* In transitioning regimes, the choice of electoral systems is based upon what is familiar for the leaders and not necessarily what is most likely to sustain the regime.
	* Most British colonies used the FPTP system while French lands used the runoff 
	* States in Latin America use the PR
* Toe goal of this paper is to consider how space matters - how voter distribution across a geographical and political space matters in the consolidation of a democracy. Additionally, the researchers aim to test how spatial distribution interacts with the electoral system.
* Space Decision Support Systems uses geographical data based on a GIS model to plot spatial distribution.
* Results suggest that where one person lives influences their party support, even in PR systems.
* Voters identify their political stance based on their place of residence, which makes this factor important in rising democracies where there are divides between agrarian districts and urban ones.
