	Annote = {This article covers a historical overview of interests in the rural and urban population in the UK. Through a historical analysis, the researcher finds that there are different interests between the urban and rural dwellers in terms of how they want to protect the environment and grow the economy. Since the urban residents outnumber the rural when it comes to elections, urban interests of Labor often take over the government. Yet, with the election of the Labor party in 1997 to government, there is a shift in the focus on rural interersts. Therefore, this article suggests that place leads to different interests that are voiced in elections or through unions (i.e. the Countryside Alliance) even if there are not necessarily divides in political ideology based on place of residence.},

@article{knoke_political_1977,
	Abstract = {Historical rural American political behavior has revolved around the three themes of radicalism, conservatism, and apathy. Post-World War II research on urban-rural differences reveals little support either for contemporary rural radicalism or greater political apathy in rural areas. However, rural citizens, particularly farmers, exhibit more conservative political orientations than metropolitan populations. The reapportionment revolution of the 1960s, which proponents thought would reduce rural advantage in state and national government, has not noticeably altered social policy outputs of state legislatures or the Congress in a more liberal, urban-oriented direction. The Electoral College currently under-represents rural influence in electing the president, although various alternatives tend to discriminate in reverse. Future trends suggest a diminishing political difference between rural and urban populations. Exposure of rural residents to mass media and the interchange of populations between geographic areas imply a gradual homogenization of social, cultural, and political values which will ultimately render country and city indistinguishable in terms of political behavior. Other social dimensions play a more central role in political conflict than the rural-urban dimension. Leaving aside the possibility of an unforeseen crisis, rural interests are unlikely to capture national political attention.},

@article{glenn_rural-urban_1967,
	Annote = {The reasearch in this article considers several public opinion polls as a way to understand the differences in political attitudes between urban and rural America. The results from this analysis of data suggests that farmers living in rural area are less likely to trust others, less likely to favor birth control, and broadly speaking, more likely to be conservative. When it comes to religion, the farmers were more traditionalist and fundamentalist in their beliefs. The people whose responses were analyzed here reflect members in the South, and results suggest that individuals who were older and less educated tend to favor more authoritarian systems of government than their younger and better educated counterparts. However, while these trends are obseved, there are too little pieces of information for the researchers to conclude whether the effects observed here are based on a true rural-urban divide, or by age, race, income, SES, and other realted factors given that farmers' responses are similar to the responses of manual workers but different from other white-collar workers. },

The goal was to understand any divergences in voting behavior between these people. Through data analyses that considered regional factors, the results suggest that there is a divergence in how people vote based on where they live. While these patterns are only prevalant after 1980, the results suggest that urban and suburban residents are increasingly diverging on their partisan support. This political polarization is prevalant and increasing as suburban voters move towards support the right wing party while the urban residents move towards supporting the left wing parties. As a result, place matters and characteristics of the place do play a role in this observed trend.},

@article{walks_place_2004,
	Abstract = {This article examines the degree to which divergence in voting behavior and political attitudes between inner cities and suburbs in Canadian metropolitan areas can be explained by place of residence. As of yet, there has been very little research done on this topic in Canada. Logistic regression models derived from the 1965, 1984 and 2000 Canadian national election surveys confirm that Canadian inner cities and (particularly, outer) suburbs are diverging, and place of residence has become increasingly important in explaining this divergence. Over the study period, residents of inner cities in Canada became more likely to vote for parties of the left and to hold attitudes that would be considered on the left of the political spectrum, while suburban residents were increasingly likely to vote for parties of the right and to hold attitudes on the right of the political spectrum. The research suggests that in Canada, as in the US, the place and context of suburbia is a factor in the shift to the right. This has implications for the future direction of welfare state policy.},
	Annote = {In the 2003 election, Canada's New Democratic party (NDP - left wing) chose leaders who would prioritize the needs of the cities. Their candidate had a background of helping reform the inner cities, and their support poured in from that region. At that point, the inner cities were known to be of the left and the suburbs lean to the right. Most of the research in this topic have been conducted in the context of the United States, and this paper aims to see if the same relationship exists in Canada. Specifically, the researchers are interested in understanding if the suburbs are a major factor contributing to the rise and continuous support of right wing leaders. The data for this study comes from the Canada Elections Study (CES). The results suggest that place of residence plays an important role in structuring party preference. Furthermore, increasing polarization between party preferences for city versus suburban dwellers is moving along the same magnitude as party polarization. },

@article{walks_causes_2006,
	Abstract = {Recent research conducted in both the United States and Canada has found that residents of inner cities and suburbs are diverging in their voting behavior and political attitudes. The mechanisms producing such a divergence, however, have remained unclear. After identifying a set of distinct hypotheses for why one might expect residents of inner cities and suburbs to differ in their political views, this article draws on a survey undertaken by the author in one electoral district in the Toronto region to empirically test the relative contribution of each of the hypothesized mechanisms in explaining the geography of party preferences. This study suggests there is no single explanation for the city-suburban cleavage, and that the mechanisms producing it are complex. Spatial segregation (based on individual attributes such as race, ethnicity, and class) is clearly important; however neighborhood self-selection, local experience, and, to a lesser extent, mode of consumption all have significant independent effects. Particularly important is the self-selection of supporters of political parties on the left into the inner city, stemming either from a search for a ``sense of community'' or the desire to link their lifestyle choices to their political convictions, whereas supporters of parties farther to the right are more likely to choose postwar suburban neighborhoods out of a preference for private space. In contrast, there is little evidence that housing tenure or the sharing of political information between neighbors are factors independently producing city-suburban political differences within the study district.},

@article{mckee_suburban_2003,
	Abstract = {Two observations have gained widespread acceptance in the wake of the 2000 presidential election. First, America has become a ``49 percent nation,'' in which it will be difficult for either the Republicans or the Democrats to wrest much of an advantage, either in congressional or presidential elections. Second, in this ultracompetitive environment, national elections will be decided in the sub urbs. This article examines the dynamics of suburban voting, paying particular attention to movement away from Republican presidential candidates in the 1990s. The authors consider the argument that the shift in political preferences of suburban voters was driven by changes in northern but not southern suburbs. They also investigate the notion that changes in the suburbs are due to demographic shifts favorable to Democratic candidates. Survey data demonstrate that the hypothesized changes have occurred but that they are neither regionally localized nor attributable solely to demographic shifts.},

Combining survey analyses and geocoded polling station data analyses of the 2010 parliamentary elections, it is found that overrepresentation of support in suburban environments cannot be explained by voter composition alone. There is a positive contextual effect in lower-density neighbourhoods in cities and in suburban municipalities, as well as in post-war New Towns. To account for spatial variations, an explanatory framework is proposed based on urban theories of class, revanchism and nostalgia. Traditional middle classes, concentrated in suburbs, seem to support RRPPs to reclaim urban space for daily use and as a defensive strategy in view of metropolitan change.]},

The opposing party, PVV, is more friendly towards urban residents The results from the 2010 election suggests that urban areas are more likely to support the PVV, unless these areas have high levels of immigrant peoples, whihc may signal that the relation is due to social composition. The concentration of social classes that is unique to the political environment may also matter in determining how the people living in each neighborhood support political parties. In short, place of residence may not fully explain political preferences. },

@article{monroe_electoral_2002,
	Abstract = {Electoral systems scholarship has frequently focused on the role of district magnitude-the number of seats awarded per district-in shaping party systems. The basic insight is that an increase in district magnitude will tend to increase the number of parties and party system fragmentation. District magnitude varies in many electoral systems, but cross-national research summarizes this distribution with a single number. We argue here that magnitude variation itself has important partisan political consequences, which we refer to collectively as the "variance effect." The variance effect creates disadvantages for urban political interests relative to rural interests, making it more difficult for urban and other correlated interests to convert support into parliamentary representation and to obtain unfragmented parliamentary representation. We demonstrate, with analyses of twenty-four elections in sixteen countries, that the variance effect operates as theoretically predicted and is surprisingly important.},

@article{holloway_burning_2007,
	Abstract = {In the past decade geographers have critiqued the exclusivity of idyllic representations of rurality and sought to explore the diverse experiences of Other social groups in the countryside. This paper builds upon that small but significant strand of research which has highlighted the whiteness of representations of rurality and the consequences of this for racialised minorities. These debates have been crucially important in forwarding our understanding of racially-exclusive constructions of idyllic country living; however, it is important that academics neither assume that such ideas are forever fixed, nor that they affect all minority ethnic groups in the same ways. This paper takes both the potential power and frailty of these ideas seriously, as it examines how the concepts of race, racism and rurality are deployed by different commentators as they debate the place of one specific minority ethnic group in the English countryside. The route taken into this is a consideration of print-media reporting of events in Firle, Sussex, where, in 2003, some white rural residents symbolically purged their village of Gypsy-Travellers by burning a mock caravan complete with effigies at their annual bonfire celebrations. In conclusion, the paper challenges the relative lack of attention to these issues within the white-dominated discipline of geography, and argues that it is imperative to trace the dynamic ways in which the whiteness of idyllic understandings of the rural are reinforced and challenged through contemporary social practice.},
	Annote = {The goal of this paper is to explore the gap between race and rurality - do racial minorities in rural areas get represented well by the British government? The countryside has been historically portrayed by the white landscape - that is, prefominately white people. Yet, this vision of the countryside is problematic because it does not accurately depict the demographics of the inhabitants in a truly precise manner. The method in this study is a case study of the media reporting of a bonfire celebration in a rural village of Firle in the UK. The event was significant because it showed distaste towards the Gypsie minority in the area. From the reports of interviews with local residents, many dismissed the activities given their views of the town as unformly white, and that racial hatred has no place here. Meanwhile, urban residents would recongize this event as a form of ethnic cleansing. This points to the differences in conceptualization of rural life and the rural consciousness broadly speaking, and it depends on your place of residence. The paper points out the need to move beyond the popular conceptualizations of rurality to understand the underlying conflicts that may be impactful to the lives of individual minotirites who live there. },

	Abstract = {This paper focuses on the representation of post-productive countryside in Finland by exploring how the rural is presented in the context of second home tourism. Being an integral part of rural areas and their history, second homes are an established example of the post-productive consumption of countryside. The international and Finnish literature on rural images provides the theoretical framework for the paper. Research on rural visions has been active in recent years with an emphasis on the Anglocentric interpretations of the rural idyll. This paper contributes to this discussion by providing an empirical review of Finnish popular discourses of second homes. The review is based on an analysis of second-home owners' motives and media representations. The second home countryside is analysed as a farmscape, wildscape and activityscape. The results suggest that the Finnish second home landscape is seen as wilderness (1), life at second homes imitates visions of traditional rural life (2), and the environment is used for traditional consumptive and leisure activities (3).},

The analysis then identifies the main divisive issues and their effect upon the party system. The social structure and electoral behavior helps to identify emerging cleavages.

Political parties appear with social stratisfication in these democracies. Yet, in order for the democracy to be established, there needs to be space for divisions to be hammered out. Divides, or cleavages, can come from a variety of sources, most notably, social structure, social groups, and political actors. The Urban/Rural dimension is an example of the cleavage that is part of Lithuanian society. Parties such as the Farmer's union and Peasant People's Party support rural resident's rights. The opening of the market economy leads to the introduction of landowners, something that the rural residents are vehemently against. Other divides in a society come from religion, ethnicity and politician preferences. },

Based on participant observation of conversations from May 2007 to May 2011 among 37 regularly occurring groups in 27 communities sampled across Wisconsin, this study shows that in some places, people have a class- and place-based identity that is intertwined with a perception of deprivation. The rural consciousness revealed here shows people attributing rural deprivation to the decision making of (urban) political elites, who disregard and disrespect rural residents and rural lifestyles. Thus these rural residents favor limited government, even though such a stance might seem contradictory to their economic self-interests. The results encourage us to consider the role of group consciousness-based perspectives rather than pitting interests against values as explanations for preferences. Also, the study suggests that public opinion research more seriously include listening to the public.},

The model is based on the assumptions that people have stored information and emotional reactions to social groups, and that people are purposive in their thinking about social groups in the sense that they are interested in understanding what various groups have obtained and whether it is deserved. The process through which social groups influence political thinking varies significantly depending upon whether an individual identifies with the group in question. Generally, people are more inclined to feel sympathetic towards the groups to which they belong. These ideas are illustrated with an empirical analysis that focuses on women's issues and makes use of data collected in the 1984 National Election Study Pilot Study.},

Self-categorization theory makes a basic distinction between personal and social identity as different levels of self-categorization. It shows how the emergent properties of group processes can be explained in terms of a shift in self perception from personal to social identity. It also elucidates how self-categorization varies with the social context. It argues that self-categorizing is inherently variable, fluid, and context dependent, as sedf-categories are social comparative and are always relative to a frame of reference. This notion has major implications for accepted ways of thinking about the self: The variability of self-categorizing provides the perceiver with behavioral and cognitive flexibility and ensures that cognition is always shaped by the social context in which it takes place.},

We address the relative influence of issue attitudes and group evaluations on party and candidate preferences in the United States. Methods. Building on Abramowitz's (1994) models, we use regression analysis to assess whether and how group evaluations influence party identification and presidential candidate evaluations, relying on data from the National Election Studies in 1988 and 1992. Results. Issue attitudes do have an important influence on individuals' political judgments, but people's evaluations of groups associated with the political parties also influence their political judgments independently of issue attitudes. The politically relevant groups do not merely represent traditional interests, such as labor and business, or even race---indeed, they primarily represent cultural differences. Conclusions. It appears that evaluations of groups and, thus, judgments of the parties and candidates themselves reflect a broad ideology of intergroup relations.},

Consequently, in this paper the effects of group identification on political perception and evaluation are investigated. Theoretically, a schematic approach is adopted in outlining the perceptual effects of group identifications. Empirically, data from the 1980 National Election Study are used to test some of the hypotheses derived from this schematic approach. The results from this analysis suggest that group identifications play an important role in defining the perceptual viewpoints that people bring to bear on politics; people identifying with different groups focus on different things and evaluate political issues from different perspectives.},

They root this conception of themselves as country people in nature, making this identity a particularly secure one. These real social consequences suggest that sociology should no longer doubt the reality of the rural-urban continuum, at least at the level of the definition of the situation. It, therefore, should remain an important topic of sociological study.},

This article starts from the assumption that the current process of globalization or denationalization leads to the formation of a new structural conflict in Western European countries, opposing those who benefit from this process against those who tend to lose in the course of the events. The structural opposition between globalization `winners' and `losers' is expected to constitute potentials for political mobilization within national political contexts, the mobilization of which is expected to give rise to two intimately related dynamics: the transformation of the basic structure of the national political space and the strategic repositioning of the political parties within the transforming space. The article presents several hypotheses with regard to these two dynamics and tests them empirically on the basis of new data concerning the supply side of electoral politics from six Western European countries (Austria, Britain, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland). The results indicate that in all the countries, the new cleavage has become embedded into existing two-dimensional national political spaces, that the meaning of the original dimensions has been transformed, and that the configuration of the main parties has become triangular even in a country like France.},

	Abstract = {Since the publication of the volume Rural Studies in Britain and France (1990) by P. Lowe and M. Bodiguel, `la ruralit{\'e}fran{\c c}aise' has become the object of intense scrutiny and has emerged as a political field where questions of national and collective identity, traditions, history, landscapes, the past and future of French society have all been debated. In the introduction to that volume, the editors declared: `The countryside and rural society, their past, present and future, are major preoccupations in Britain and in France. The urbanisation of the two nations has in no way diminished this interest; if anything, it has sharpened it. With the bulk of economic and social activity concentrated in towns and cities, the countryside has come to embody largely a cultural interest in both countries', something that has been borne out by recent events. This special issue devoted to `Politics, tradition and modernity in rural France' is the first issue of Modern \& Contemporary France to be dedicated to a discussion of topics surrounding la question agricole. The recent publication of a short dossier on French agriculture in the journal French Politics, Society and Culture pointed the way to a number of the debates examined in the following articles about the past and the future of rural France, especially in the context of a more globalised and Europeanised economy.},

@article{martin_saline_1997,
	Abstract = {Participatory approaches to sustainable development have become increasingly popular world‐wide. In Australia, participatory approaches such as landcare and regional catchment management form the basis of rural environmental policy and practice. At the same time, neoliberalist reforms such as market deregulation and withdrawal of state assistance from agriculture have been implemented. Various commentators have suggested that local participatory practices can enable neoliberal reforms by depoliticising rural environmental problems and fragmenting action. This paper explores the intersection of these participatory policy developments and neoliberal reforms through two case studies on the government of salinity in the Hunter Valley, New South Wales. From this work, it is apparent that neoliberal reforms result in competition for resources within the state, the projectisation of environmental action, and a hesistance of the state to allocate resources for broader environmental monitoring. This work demonstrates how the contradictions in these developments can create a chaotic and irrational environmental politics that can result in a repoliticisation of rural environments and opportunities for a more rational and democratic sustainable development practice.},

Additionally, the researchers also look at the infleucne of rurality on political efficacy. The researchers administered a survey to South Koreans and the results suggest that memebers of a farming town are more likely to feel subordinated in the political atmosphere and experience lower feelings of political efficacy than their urban counterparts. Since the government is currently working on rural development, it would be beneficial for them to check the results of this study to see what is going on regarding the popular political efficacy and the long term success that the project can yeild.},

@article{lee_politics_1996,
	Abstract = {This paper addresses the nature of regions in Korean politics. Our investigation focuses on ways in which Korean society and the economy are reflected in the political (electoral) process, and how they are embedded in provincialism. We examine three questions: (1) can the concept of regional politics be applied to Korea; (2) in what ways is regional politics contingent upon the mode of production and spheres of consumption; and (3) in what ways is it manifested in the electoral process? We analyze regional data on industrial output, the state's recruitment practice for high government officials, variations in income distribution, and voter turnout in the 1992 and 1987 presidential elections. The findings suggest that Korea's regional politics was cultivated by the interests of the ruling party, which were tied closely to regional economic differentiation; it was not mobilized by grassroots politics. While this provincial favoritism has served the political legitimacy of the ruling party, the very process seemed to reinforce social discontent between regions as well as classes. Provincial favoritism in recent presidential voting was strong in some regions, especially Cholla and Kyungsang. This regional segregation of voting was also complicated by non-provincial votes, such as Seoul, which was more likely associated with voters' economic interests than any provincial favoritism for a presidential candidate. The regional votes seem to be transient and liable to merge into other social and political forces.},
