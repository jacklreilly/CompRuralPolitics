***Jennifer Lin*** | Transitions to Democracy

## *Guiding Question*

How does place of residence (rural/urban) influence policy preferences in countries based on the countryâ€™s style of government? Does place attachments influence conservative or liberal stances in the context of the country in which the individual lives?

I am interested in understanding the influence of place of residence on individual ideology. If the electoral system is a factor to mitigate the relationship between place and ideology, I am interested in understanding the role that said system plays on the relationship.

Furthermore, does the age of the democracy influence the relationship (if any) observed between neighborhood context and ideology? If so, how? Is this relationship more salient with countries that have long established their democracy or can this relationship establish once the democracy establishes?

Additionally, is this more pronounced in a first-past-the-post electoral system or in a proportional electoral system? How does the number of representatives influence vote choice and ideology?

The data for this project will come from CSES Module 4 survey data. I an leaning towards using STATA for data analysis but it is also likely that I may use R or SAS to conduct the analysis.

## *Key Variables for Analysis*

In the analysis the key independent variable is Rural/Urban place of residence and individual's country of residence (and its electoral system, age of democracy)

For the dependent variable we are interested in
- Party the individual voted for in the most recent election
- Individual stance on issues (whether they took a consistent conservative stance or consistently liberal stance or in between)
- Individual self-placement on the left-right scale.
