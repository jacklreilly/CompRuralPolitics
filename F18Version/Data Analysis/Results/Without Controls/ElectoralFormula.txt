Influence of Electoral Formula

Electoral Formula description

D5058       >>> ELECTORAL FORMULA IN ALL ELECTORAL SEGMENTS
                         (TIERS)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

         This is a variable indicating whether the country uses (i) a
         majoritarian formula in all of its electoral segments (tiers),
         (ii) a proportional formula in all of its electoral segments
         (tiers), or (iii) a mixed formula.

         The definition of this variable is taken from Matt Golder's
         database about Democratic Electoral Systems Around the World,
         1946-2000 (http://mattgolder.com/elections, Date accessed: May 17,
         2018).

         MAJORITARIAN systems require successful candidates to win either
         a plurality or majority of the vote. As a result, they are
         considered majoritarian.
         PROPORTIONAL systems can be divided into two types: those that use
         party lists and those like the single transferable vote that do
         not. Those systems employing lists can themselves be divided into
         two further categories: quota systems (with allocation of
         remainders) and highest average systems.
         MIXED systems use a mixture of majoritarian and proportional
         electoral rules. A country can be classified as having a mixed
         system whether it uses one or more electoral segments (tiers); in
         practice, most mixed systems have more than one segment (tier).
         Mixed electoral systems can be divided into those in which the
         two electoral formulas are dependent and those in which they are
         independent.

         |
         | For the Chamber of Deputies elections (lower house), Argentina
         | used a proportional closed-list system. Most parties use
         | primaries to select and order their party lists. Members elected
         | to the Chamber of Deputies are elected for a four-year term 
         | which is renewable. Half of the Chamber is renewed every two
         | years. There are 24 multi-member districts with a party/alliance
         | needing to exceed 3 percent of the registered electors to 
         | secure a seat.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - AUSTRIA (2013): D5058
         |
         | The Austrian electoral system is a proportional representation
         | system with three segments or tiers. These correspond to the
         | federal level tier, the Land level tier (or state level) and the
         | regional districts tier. Counting and allocation of seats passes
         | through each of these levels.
         | Voters can cast a (single) party vote on an open list and
         | indicate their preferred candidate on the respective party list.

         | The Icelandic Althingi (Parliament) has 63 members, where 54
         | members are elected from 6 multi-member (9 seats apiece)
         | constituencies (first tier). In addition, there is a second
         | tier, comprising of 9 "supplementary" seats that are
         | allocated to parties (using the D'Hondt method) to ensure the
         | number of seats they receive is in proportion to its national
         | vote. However, only party lists that obtain at least 5% of
         | the national vote are entitled to receive these seats.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - ROMANIA (2012): D5058
         |
         | Electoral reform came on to the agenda in Romania in the 
         | aftermath of 2004 elections and the election of a weak 
         | centre-right coalition between the National Liberal Party (PNL) 
         | and the Democratic (PD) parties. However, it was a feud between  
         | President of Romania and the Romanian parliament that brought
         | the issue to the fore. In 2007, the party alliance of the 
         | PNL and the PD split. The Romanian parliament then voted to 
         | impeach President Basescu, a proponent of electoral reform, 
         | accusing him of abuse of power. The row was sparked by the 
         | decision of then Justice Minister Monica Macovei to take the 
         | appointment of special prosecutors into the domain of the 
         | president, where previously it had been the responsibility of 
         | an independent body. A national referendum was held 
         | on May 19, 2007 to decide whether the president's dismissal by 
         | parliament would be upheld. However, the proposal was defeated
         | in a low turnout referendum and Basescu was reinstated as
         | Romanian President shortly afterwards. After his reinstatement, 
         | President Basescu made electoral reform a central issue,
         | calling for a national referendum on the subject. Initially 
         | President Basescu and Prime Minister Tariceanu put forward 
         | rival models of electoral reform. However, after months of 
         | debate on the subject, including a referendum on the issue, 
         | a compromise was eventually agreed and a new electoral system 
         | was adopted in time for the 2008 parliamentary elections. 
         | 
         | The system adopted was candidate centred, with voters having one
         | vote for the Chamber of Deputies (Lower House) and one vote for
         | the Senate. The systems is classified as a mixed system because 
         | it employs both majoritarian and proportional rules.  Voters 
         | cast ballots in single member districts. However, the seat 
         | allocation procedure is notably complex and operates over 
         | multiple tiers. Districts are geographically identical to 
         | counties and each county is divided into several single member 
         | districts, known in Romania as colleges. Voters are initially 
         | aggregated at national level to determine which parties have
         | passed the explicit electoral threshold (see variable D5046 and
         | variable D5047) and are thus eligible for seats. 
         | Direct seats are won by polling 50% in a district; however, 
         | candidates winning over 50% in their districts win the seat
         | only if their party passes the appropriate threshold. 
         | However, a party can also enter parliament if it wins at least 
         | three Senate and six Deputy districts in the first tier  
         | regardless of the percentage of votes the party obtains at the 
         | national level. 
         | To decide on seat allocation, the number of votes won by each
         | of the parties is totalled and divided by the number of seats 
         | (corresponding to the number of districts) established for each
         | constituency, thus obtaining an electoral quota. Then, the
         | number of votes won by each party is divided by the quota, thus
         | giving the number of seats to which each party is entitled. The
         | second stage involves thee remainders of these divisions being
         | summed up for each party at the national level using the D'Hondt
         | system, thus giving a ranked list of parties. Then, in the
         | district, the first party on the list, regardless of its votes 
         | has priority in the redistribution process, the second party on
         | the list follows, and so forth. Candidates belonging to the
         | parties that passed the threshold - winning over 50% of the
         | votes in their district - are automatically elected and their
         | districts are no longer included in the next stages of the seat
         | allocation process. 
         | The candidates from districts without a first round winner then 
         | enter the redistribution process. In each constituency, the 
         | candidates of each party are ranked in the order of the number 
         | of votes obtained by each of them in the district in which they 
         | ran. Based on the quota, each party receives a number of seats
         | corresponding to its quota. After this stage, the Electoral 
         | Commission determines the number of seats the party is entitled
         | to in the final distribution.      
         | For 2012, the Chamber of Deputies elected 412 members and the 
         | Senate elected 176 members. Seats are reserved in parliament for
         | 18 ethnic minority groups representing Germans, Romas, 
         | Macedonians, Armenians, Bulgarians, Albanians, Jews, Tatars, 
         | Czechs/Slovaks, Russians/Lipovians, Serbs, Poles, Italians, 
         | Ukrainians, Turks, Croatians, and Ruthenians.

         | The South African electoral system is a closed-list 
         | proportional representation system. The National Assembly 
         | seats are filled in two tiers: Half (200) seats are 
         | regional seats and filled by reference to regional votes 
         | and regional lists (representing nine federal provinces); 
         | the other half (200) are national seats and filled by 
         | reference to national votes and national lists (or 
         | entirely from regional lists if a party did not submit 
         | a separate national list).

         | representation (PR) seats, elected from a single nation-wide 
         | district. Each voter casts two votes, one for an individual 
         | candidate in the SMD segment, and one for a closed party list 
         | in the PR segment.
